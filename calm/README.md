# Common Architecture Language Model

The Common Architecture Language Model (CALM) is a specification for defining system architectures in a machine and human-readable format.

The intention of CALM is to enable a common language for describing system architectures, and to enable tooling to support the creation, validation, and visualization of architectures.

CALM is considered to be a work in progress, and is currently in the early stages of development. The specification is currently being developed by the [Architecture as Code Community](https://devops.finos.org/docs/working-groups/aasc/).
