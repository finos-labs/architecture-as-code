# Architecture as Code

**Architecture as Code (AasC)** aims to devise and manage software architecture via a human and machine readable and version-controlled
codebase, fostering a robust understanding, efficient development, and seamless maintenance of complex software
architectures.

This repository contains the Common Architecture Language Model (CALM) Specification, as well as capabilities being
built to utilize the
specification. This page lists the domains and capabilities being built by the official AasC community.

Whilst others are welcome to build their own capabilities, away from the AasC monorepo, we encourage you to join the
community and contribute your projects to the AasC monorepo which has the benefits of being visible to the whole
community; thereby attracting contributions and ensuring that changes to the manifest will be proactively built against
your project.

## Getting Involved
Architecture as Code is part of the [DevOps Automation Special Interest Group](https://devops.finos.org/docs/working-groups/aasc/). Our Zoom meetups take place on the fourth Tuesday of every month, see [here](https://github.com/finos/devops-automation/issues?q=label%3Ameeting+label%3Aarchitecture-as-code+) for upcoming and previous meetings.

Have an idea or feedback? [Raise an issue](https://github.com/finos-labs/architecture-as-code/issues/new/choose) in this repository.
