# Architecture as Code

**Architecture as Code (AasC)** aims to devise and manage software architecture via a readable and version-controlled
codebase, fostering a robust understanding, efficient development, and seamless maintenance of complex software
architectures.

This repository contains the Common Architecture Language Model (CALM) Specification, as well as capabilities being built to utilize the
specification. This page lists the domains and capabilities being built by the official AasC community.

Whilst others are welcome to build their own capabilities, away from the AasC monorepo, we encourage you to join the
community and contribute your projects to the AasC monorepo which has the benefits of being visible to the whole
community; thereby attracting contributions and ensuring that changes to the manifest will be proactively built against
your project.
