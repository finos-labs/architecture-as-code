# Getting started

To get started, clone the project and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

When you've made a change to the CLI and want to test it out, you can rerun the build and link steps.
This will make the CLI available on your machine.

Type `calm` into your terminal, and you should see the help text printed out.
